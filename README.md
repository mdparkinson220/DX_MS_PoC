HCL DX with micro-services demo

After reading Cameron McKenzie's article (https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/How-to-refactor-a-Java-portlet-application-for-a-cloud-native-future), I succumbed to curiosity and came up with this proof-of-concept.  This is composed of 3 applications:
- An Angular application which is deployed as a script portlet
- A Java Servlet application deployed on the HCL/IBM Portal server
- A Spring Boot application 

To run these applications, you will require the following
- HCL DX Portal server
- Spring Tool Suite (STS) development environment
- Eclipse
